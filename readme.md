This analysis seeks to quantify the levels of harm caused / travel time and distance cost incurred in this new regulatory landscape. Intuitively, someone seeking care in Pennsylvania would have an easier time crossing state lines for care vs someone in Louisiana. This attempts to wrap our heads around these inequities. 

Full success could be creating a model to focus resources that reduce the net cost/harm incurred. E.g. while establishing protections in Idaho would be a good thing, it wouldn't help nearly as many people as establishing protections in Tennessee.
